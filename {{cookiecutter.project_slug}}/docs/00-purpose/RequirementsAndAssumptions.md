# Requirements and Assumptions

This section will be heavy on tables which spell out design requirements and assumptions.

## Design Requirements, Assumptions, and Constraints

The following tables document the requirements, assumptions, and constraints that were known or discovered during the design process. While every attempt was made to be thorough the tables should not be considered exhaustive.

|ID  |Requirement  |
|---------|---------|
|r001     | Example requirement         |
|r002     | Another example        |

|ID  |Assumptions  |
|---------|---------|
|a001     | Example assumption         |
|a002     | Another example        |

|ID  |Constraint  |
|---------|---------|
|c001     | Example constraint         |
|c002     | Another example        |
